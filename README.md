## üìö API Documentation

### Core Functions

#### Wallet Management
```typescript
// Generate a new random 12-word mnemonic
generateRandomMnemonic(): string

// Validate a mnemonic phrase
validateMnemonic(mnemonic: string): boolean

// Initialize wallet with optional mnemonic

```

## üîí Security Considerations

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Important Security Notes:**

1. **Never share your mnemonic phrase** with anyone
2. **Mnemonics are stored in browser memory only** - they are never sent to any server
3. **Always verify the website URL** before entering sensitive information
4. **Consider using a hardware wallet** for large amounts
5. **This is a demo implementation** - additional security measures should be implemented for production use:
   - Encrypted storage
   - Multi-signature support
   - Hardware wallet integration
   - Session management
   - Rate limiting
